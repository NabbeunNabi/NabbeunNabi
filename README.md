-  Hello, I’m Will Brammer. I am originally from the U.S. but am currently living in Japan.
-  Technically, I am interested in Full Stack Development and Dev-Ops. Personally, I love sports (baseball the most) and games.
-  I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms. In the future I would like to learn AWS and am looking into courses to be an AWS Certified Solutions Architect.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that positively impact the environment and/or the restaurant industry.
-  Do not hesitate to contact me at williamedwardbrammer@gmail.com or connect with me and contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-brammer/).
-  If you have problems choosing restaurants while out with friends and have decision paralysis, I recommend [Jacareview](https://www.jacareview.com/).
